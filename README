 Welcome to Taskman

This is an open source app to help maximize the z in LaZy.

We all need more time, that means more ZZzzzzz...

Myself, i'm awake at all times because I'm trying to pursue an impossibility and that leaves me with a wild sense of bewilderment and an utter lack of control.  SOOO i work longer, harder and have less ZZzzzz...

I realiazed that by embracing lazy and enhancing it to it's maximum potential will bring many positives.  One being sleep.
